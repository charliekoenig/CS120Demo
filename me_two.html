        <h2>A Trip I Took Recently:</h2>

        <div>
            I went to London and Paris for Spring Break to visit my girlfriend
            who spent the semester abroad. This was my first time traveling out 
            of the country and I was flying alone so it was intimidating, but I 
            made it. We took the train to Paris which was expensive but so much
            easier than flying. Despite my three years of middle school French,
            I was completely lost in conversation. On top of the language 
            barrier, my overwhelming desire to be liked by random strangers made
            simple tasks like ordering a sandwich a mentally exhausting 
            experience.

        <div> <!-- start of restuarant paragraph -->
            The food is great but I love the owner, Johan, more than anything 
            else. It's $6 for a bowl plus whatever special Johan made that day,
            usually empanadas. In highschool, I would walk here for lunch a few 
            times a week and come after practice if he hadn't sold out of food 
            yet. (No website so I linked the instagram)

        <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>

        <!-- wrap text right, 20px margin between image and tex -->
        <div id="sushiPic"></div>
        <div>My favorite sushi is anything salmon-based with soy sauce and 
            wasabi. Last summer, when I worked remote, I would walk to an 
            all-you-can-eat place for lunch which always had a weekday lunch 
            special. The quality might not have been the highest but at least I 
            could afford it.<br><br>I've tried to make my own sushi before but 
            the rice didn't turn out well and my rolling left a lot of room for 
            improvement.<br><br><strong>I chose this picture because it was 
            high quality (although I ruined it when I changed the size) I am 
            strongly against cream cheese on sushi.</strong>
