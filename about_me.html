        <h3>A Trip I Took Recently:</h3>
        <div>
            I went to London and Paris for Spring Break to visit my girlfriend
            who spent the semester abroad. This was my first time traveling out 
            of the country and I was flying alone so it was intimidating, but I 
            made it. We took the train to Paris which was expensive but so much
            easier than flying. Despite my three years of middle school French,
            I was completely lost in conversation. On top of the language 
            barrier, my overwhelming desire to be liked by random strangers made
            simple tasks like ordering a sandwich a mentally exhausting 
            experience.

        <!-- nested list, ordered outside, unordered nested -->
        <ol>
            <li>A dog named Wallie</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm biased because this was my dog's name</li>
                </ul>
            <li>A dog named Sid</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        No explanation, just always a favorite. Unfortunatly
                        very similar to "sit"
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>A gerbil named Dmitry</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some more bias as this was my roomate's gerbil's name</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

            The food is great but I love the owner, Johan, more than anything 
            else. It's $6 for a bowl plus whatever special Johan made that day,
            usually empanadas. In highschool, I would walk here for lunch a few 
            times a week and come after practice if he hadn't sold out of food 
            yet. (No website so I linked the instagram)

            My favorite sushi is anything salmon-based with soy sauce and 
            wasabi. Last summer, when I worked remote, I would walk to an 
            all-you-can-eat place for lunch which always had a weekday lunch 
            special. The quality might not have been the highest but at least I 
            could afford it.<br><br>I've tried to make my own sushi before but 
            the rice didn't turn out well and my rolling left a lot of room for 
            improvement.<br><br><strong>I chose this picture because it was 
            high quality I am strongly against cream cheese on sushi.</strong>
